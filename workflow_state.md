# SentinelSecure Workflow State

State:
  Phase: Blueprint
  Status: NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL

Summary:
  - Architecture, tech stack, module breakdown, CI/CD, and packaging plan drafted for VER3
  - Awaiting user approval to scaffold repo and begin construction phase

Next Steps:
  - On approval, initialize repo structure (backend, llm_service, frontend, scripts, .cursor)
  - Scaffold Go backend, Python LLM service, React frontend, CI/CD, Windows installer 

I have finished exploring the project and am ready for your instructions. Here is a summary of my findings:

*   **Architecture**: The project is a web-based security scanner with a Go backend, a React frontend, and a Python LLM service.
*   **Backend**: The backend is a Go application that exposes a REST API for scanning, logging, and health checks. It uses a phase-based engine to perform scans, but many of the scanning modules are currently stubs with TODOs for implementation. It uses nmap for reconnaissance and communicates with the LLM service for analysis.
*   **Frontend**: The frontend is a React application built with Vite that provides a user interface for interacting with the backend. It allows users to start scans, view results, filter findings, and check the status of the services.
*   **LLM Service**: The LLM service is a Python application using FastAPI that exposes an endpoint for text analysis. There are some inconsistencies between the code (which uses a GGUF model via `llama-cpp-python`), the `requirements.txt` file, and the included `SecureBERT_Plus` model files.
*   **Execution**: The `run_the_system.txt` file provides commands to run each of the three services.

I have a good high-level understanding of the project and am prepared to assist with development, debugging, or any other tasks.
